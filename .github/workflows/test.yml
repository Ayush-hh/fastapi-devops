      # Step 1: Checkout the code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout code

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install fastapi uvicorn pytest requests

      - name: Start FastAPI server
        run: |
          nohup python apiserver.py &
        env:

      # Step 5: Wait for the FastAPI server to start up (adjust the time if needed)
      - name: Wait for server to be ready
        run: sleep 10  # This ensures that the server has time to start
